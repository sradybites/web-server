# Backend layer for my website

This project started as my final project in the Intro to Backend Development course at Cornell. I want to transform this into my own personal website, but I also want to create a small web game that I will also host on this server.

## Deployment

This system will be containerized with Docker to be deployed with some cloud service. I intend to host my server with Google Cloud's Kubernetes engine.

## Built With

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - The web framework used
* [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) - Flask extension for object-relational mapping
